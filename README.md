# Wbot-Manager

Welcome to Wbot-Manager – the not-so-fancy, but totally gets-the-job-done tool for wrestling with the `bot.json` file of [WBOT](https://github.com/vasani-arpit/WBOT) by the coding sorcery of [vasani-arpit](https://github.com/vasani-arpit).

## Key Features

- **Structured Response Sections:** Keep your responses organized with named sections and groups. It's like giving your replies a neat filing system.
- **Named Contact Lists:** Easily manage blocked or allowed contacts by assigning names to them. No more guessing games!
- **Effortless Reordering:** Move things around smoothly. Rearrange response sections, contacts, and groups with a simple up and down movement.

## Getting Started

To dive into the world of Wbot-Manager:

1. Drop the executable (.exe) and its sidekicks (.dll) in the same folder as your WBOT's secret diary – the `bot.json` JSON file.
2. Hit that execution button. Simple, right?

> **Disclaimer:** Before you hit execute, maybe, just maybe, consider backing up your `bot.json`. You know, just in case.
