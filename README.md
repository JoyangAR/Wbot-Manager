## Key Features

- **Pretty Basic Stuff:** Manage your bot's `bot.config` like a boss with Section Names and Section Groups. Nothing too fancy – just the essentials.

## Getting Started

To dive into the world of Wbot-Manager:

1. Drop the executable (.exe) and its sidekicks (.dll) in the same folder as your WBOT's secret diary – the `bot.config` JSON file.
2. Hit that execution button. Simple, right?

> **Disclaimer:** Before you hit execute, maybe, just maybe, consider backing up your `bot.config`. You know, just in case.
