Sorry for the quality of my collage, I really tried. There you could see(If it were legible) some features

Main features: 
Section Names and Section Groups to organize your automated responses.

How to use:
Place the .exe & .dll in the location of the wbot bot.config json and execute.

I'd recommend backuping your bot.config before you run this... just in case.
